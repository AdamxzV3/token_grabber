# :warning: [DEPRECATED] Fixed Token Grabber :warning:

**Disclaimer**: This repository has been taken down due to it being patched and GitHub's policy on hosting malware, even for educational purposes. 

This is a fixed version of a batch token grabber that was fully undetected. It grabs the tokens of Discord clients and Discord web, and it sets the token grabber inside the Discord voice folder in the index.js. It sends the token every time Discord gets restarted. It was for the latest Discord versions 0.0.309 and the most versions after it, including the newest ones.

## :money_with_wings: Free Version

This is the free version of my grabber. a paid version with a whole bunch more and better features. If you are interested, join Baums Discord server:

## :warning: Disclaimer

I don't take any responsibility for damage done with the program. It's for educational purposes only, and it is just to prove that your antivirus isn't as good as you think, and that even if files don't have any detections, they can still harm you. Don't use this to token grab others.
